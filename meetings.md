# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 2019-02-13, 14:00**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**
* **GRADE:** *To be filled by course staff*

### Minutes

General discussion about the current state of the project.
During the meeting we went through the requirements of the first deadline and checked that the project was advancing properly. One key-point was to clarify more the API-use in machine point of view (in automation, etc.). Although the subject was discussed in preliminary planning, the subject was not originally included in the documentation.

There was also discussion about the quality of resources used in this project: required scale and unimportance of business logic. The aim of the course is not business logic, but API and hypermedia implementation. The conclusion was that the project's current state is very good.

### Action points
The action points of the meeting were the following:
* Current state of the project
* Relevance of the RESTful technology/architecture
* Quality, scalability and size of the resources
* Importance of business logic
* How to mark code as your own
* The most important points of the project
* Django and Django REST Framework implementation
* API-use from machine point of view

## Meeting 2.
* **DATE: 2019-02-28, 14:30**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**
* **GRADE:** *To be filled by course staff*

### Minutes
General discussion about the current state of the project.
The implementation of main resources was discussed and the removal of some resources, with emphasize on the interesting resources. The relationships of the resources were discussed. Marshmallow was suggested if the project group wanted to automate the project more. Hypermedia tests will be in portion 4 of the project. Portion 3 has large amount of documentation. 
Criticism offered by the course supervisor: The current url architecture is flat, urls should be nested more with hierarchy. Hypermedia type still open in project. Advised to check examples, for example mason html. 
Second critique: all methods are get, if machine client searches controls, controls should define methods. Schema needs to be defined if post is used. This is for deadline 3
API design discussed and serialisation needs to be finetuned. 

Discussion about the client, not big difference if using hypermedia client, autogenerated client is not enough, when making client some specific operation might be good. API does not need to do everything. This is after third deadline. 

Overall deadline 2 good. 

### Action points
Reread excercise 2
Expand URL tree
Finetune serialiser
Plan hypermedia and client

### Minutes
Patchia ei tartte jos ei ole pakko, patch on vähän huono metodi, voi tehdä, mutta ei paras
Enemmän työtä ja tietoa 

Patchille käyttöidea: movie detail, many to many suhde pariin asiaan, patch append ja poista, put komennolla ei mene nätisti, patchillä nätimpi. Linkit resursseja toinen tapa, massiivinen kartta jo valmiiksi toisaalta

MoviesIds, put, delete, suhde joko on olemassa tai ei. Hierarkia selvä ylös alas, horisontaaliset vaikeampia, mikä on mekaniikka, mikä category omistaa mitä, connection resurssit yksi vaihtoehto. Patch append lisää kategoria pop

Mihin riittää resurssit

Olisi hyvä kun on category niin pääsisi kategoriasta näkemään mitkä leffat on kategoriassa. Voi olla resurssi joka sisältää listan linkeistä leffoihin.

Kommentille voi nimetä uudeksi author, käytä standardeja kun mahdollista.

Suositus: Patchit kannattaa poistaa paitsi yhdet joilla kategorioita hallitaan.

Mainitaan wikitekstissä että mietitään patch uudestaan

Formaatti Hal + json

Kertoo clientille että kontekstissa ei ole mitään

Get actors, voisi sisältää suoraan listaan, count embedded

Hal:in isoin rajoite: ei tuo interaktiivisempia materiaaleja

Client harjoitus materiaalista selviää mikä on hyvä

Ei muuta, karsitaan turhia resursseja implementaatiota varten, 

Mieti hypermediaa
